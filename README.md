# Blockchain_Basic

Did you know? Blockchain technology is set to revolutionise not just finance, but also industries like supply chain management, healthcare, and even voting systems. 🌐✨

Recently, I've delved into Solidity, the programming language behind Ethereum's smart contracts. Here’s a glimpse of what I’ve covered:

Basics of Solidity: Understanding how to define variables, write functions, and utilize simple data structures.
Practical Application: I created a contract for booking hotel rooms, allowing users to book a room by sending Ether.

You can deploy the contract yourself by copying the code and pasting it into https://remix.ethereum.org/

I've documented my learning journey in more detail on Medium. Check out my article https://medium.com/@rajeshbagul2001/unlocking-solidity-for-beginners-6005047b7c9b
